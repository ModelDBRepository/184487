0. To run the model you need Brian neural simulator installed [2] and for plotting the figure as in the paper Matlab [3]. There is some preliminary plotting available within the Python script.

1. Run file prepostSTDP_savings.py in Python, which will store the simulated data in the folder fromBrian/

2. For plotting run file X.m in Matlab. This will use the data generated by the Python script, which is saved in folder fromBrian/

Note: This code is not optimized for efficiency :)
